Device tree scripts
-------------------

These device tree scripts are at present copied over from the Zephyr project,
in order to add DT capabilities to the SCP build process.
(zephyr/scripts/dts)/

The libraries are at some point going to become standalone (see README_from_Zephyr.txt),
at which point this project can grab them from the new repository, or
come up with a better process for taking them from the Zephyr project.
