 * \brief Put an event in one of the event queues.
 *
 * \details The framework copies the event description into its internal data
 *      and so does not keep track of the pointer passed as a parameter.
 *
 *      If the function is called from a thread the event is put into the
 *      targeted thread queue. Furthermore, in the runtime phase, the source
 *      identifier of the event is populated with the identifier of the caller,
 *      and it is therefore unnecessary for the caller to do so manually. Note
 *      that this does not occur in the pre-runtime phase.
 *
 *      If the function is called from an ISR, the event is put in the ISR
 *      event queue.
 *
 *      In both cases, the event identifier and target identifier are checked
 *      to be valid and to refer to the same module.
 *
 *      In the case of a delayed response event, the event's 'is_response' flag
 *      must be set.
 *
 *      If multi-threading is enabled, and \p event is a delayed response, the
 *      ::fwk_event::cookie field of \p event must match that of the event
 *      it is responding to.
 *
 * \param[in] event Pointer to the event to queue. Must not be \c NULL.
 *
 * \retval ::FWK_SUCCESS The event was queued.
 * \retval ::FWK_E_INIT The thread framework component is not initialized.
 * \retval ::FWK_E_PARAM An invalid parameter was encountered:
 *      - The `event` parameter was a null pointer value.
 *      - One or more fields of the event were invalid.
 * \retval ::FWK_E_OS Operating system error.
 *
 * \return Status code representing the result of the operation.
