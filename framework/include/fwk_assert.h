 *
 * \details The framework provides a number of assertion helpers to aid in
 *      debugging and documenting code. Most of these trigger a standard library
 *      assertion in some way, but they differ in when.
 *
 *      Choosing the most appropriate assertion helper can be complex, so their
 *      individual purposes are summarised below:
 *
 *      - ::fwk_trap() - it is unsafe to continue at all
 *      - ::fwk_unreachable() - this code is unreachable in normal
 *          operation, and it is unsafe to continue
 *      - ::fwk_unexpected() - this code is unreachable in normal operation,
 *          but it is safe to continue
 *      - ::fwk_assert(condition) - this condition holds true in normal
 *          operation, and it is unsafe to continue
 *      - ::fwk_check(condition) - this condition holds true in normal
 *          operation, but it is safe to continue (statements only)
 *      - ::fwk_expect(condition) - this condition holds true in normal
 *          operation, but it is safe to continue (branch conditions only)

 *
 * \brief Mark a code path as unreachable.
 *
 * \details In debug builds, this macro will trigger an assertion. In release
 *      builds this code path will be marked as unreachable to the compiler.
 *
 *      #### Example
 *
 *      \code{.c}
 *      int do_something(int x) {
 *          switch (x) {

 *              fwk_unreachable();
 *          }
 *      }
 *      \endcode
 *
 *      In this example, the code will assert in a debug build if the
 *      unreachable code is reached. In a release build the behaviour of the
 *      program is undefined.

 * \def fwk_unexpected
 *
 * \brief Mark a code path as unexpected.
 *
 * \details Unexpected code paths are paths which the code should never have
 *      taken, but which have associated error handling.
 *
 *      In debug builds, this macro will trigger an assertion. In release
 *      builds, or if running tests, it will do nothing.
 *
 *      #### Example
 *
 *      \code{.c}
 *      if (rand() == 42) {
 *          fwk_unexpected();
 *
 *          return FWK_E_STATE;

 *
 *      In this example, the code will assert in a debug build if `rand()`

 *      function will return `FWK_E_STATE`.

 * \details In debug builds, the macro will evaluate the condition and trigger

 *      macro will evaluate the condition and discard its result.
 *
 *      #### Example
 *

 *      *x = 42;
