 * \details Create a thread for a module or element as well as its event queue.
 *      Modules and elements bound to the module or element can then place
 *      events in its queue using the 'fwk_thread_put_event()' function from
 *      the framework API.
 *
 *      Events will be processed by the created thread when the framework calls
 *      the module or element's 'process_event()' function. Note that the thread
 *      will process only a single event from the queue each time the
 *      'process_event()' function is called.
 *
 * \param id Identifier of the module or element to create the thread for.
 *
 * \retval ::FWK_SUCCESS The module/element thread was created.
 * \retval ::FWK_E_PARAM The identifier is not a valid module or element
 *     identifier.
 * \retval ::FWK_E_INIT The thread framework component is not initialized.
 * \retval ::FWK_E_STATE The execution has already started, or it is not
 *      possible to create a thread anymore, or a thread has already been
 *      created for the given module or element.

 * \brief Put an event in a module or element thread queue and wait for it to
 *      be processed.
 *
 * \details This framework API function can only be called from a module or
 *      element's thread. The calling thread is suspended until the event
 *      has been completely processed. As a consequence, this function cannot
 *      be called during the pre-runtime phases.
 *
 *      The identifier of the event's source is filled in by the framework
 *      with the identifier of the entity calling the function. Thus there is
 *      no need for the caller to fill this event's field in.
 *
 *      The event identifier and target identifier are validated and must
 *      belong to the same module.
 *
 *      Warning: As this API could have serious adverse effects on system
 *               performance and throughput, this API has been deprecated
 *               and should not be used in single-threaded mode.
 *
 * \param event Event to put into the queue for processing. Must not be \c NULL.
 * \param[out] resp_event The response event. Must not be \c NULL.
 *
 * \retval ::FWK_SUCCESS The event was successfully processed.
 * \retval ::FWK_E_STATE The execution is not started.
 * \retval ::FWK_E_PARAM An invalid parameter was encountered:
 *      - The `event` parameter was a null pointer value.
 *      - One or more fields of the event were invalid.
 * \retval ::FWK_E_ACCESS The API is called from an ISR, called from the common
 *      thread, or the event targets the calling thread.
