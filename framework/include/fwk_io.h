 *
 * \details This framework component provides low-level input/output facilities
 *      for byte-level read/write operations on streams, where a stream
 *      represents any abstract entity that can accept or return byte data.
 *
 *      The I/O framework is largely modelled on the C standard library
 *      interfaces provided by `<stdio.h>`, except for the key difference that
 *      the I/O framework does not open files, but system entities. A system
 *      entity can be anything with an associated runtime: a module, an element
 *      or a sub-element. This leaves the precise implementation details of
 *      operating on the stream to the entity.
 *
 *      The four key interface functions are ::fwk_io_open, ::fwk_io_read,
 *      ::fwk_io_write, and ::fwk_io_close. These functions operate on streams,
 *      which are created by a call to ::fwk_io_open provided with an identifier
 *      of an entity implementing ::fwk_io_adapter. See the individual
 *      documentation for these functions for their usage documentation.
 *
 *      Creating an I/O-capable entity is a simple process, consisting of
 *      implementing the ::fwk_module::adapter field when creating your module.
 *      See the documentation for the ::fwk_io_adapter structure for more
 *      information.
 *
 *      The framework component also exposes two default streams opened upon
 *      initialization of the component: ::fwk_io_stdin and ::fwk_io_stdout.
 *      These streams are opened on the entities given by ::FMW_IO_STDIN_ID and
 *      ::FMW_IO_STDOUT_ID.
