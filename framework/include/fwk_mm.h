 *      memory allocation functions with a slightly more consistent interface
 *      and stronger portability guarantees across the variety of systems that
 *      the framework supports.

 * \brief Allocates memory for an array of `num` objects of `size`.
 *
 * \details If allocation succeeds, returns a pointer that is suitably aligned
 *      for any object type with fundamental alignment.
 *
 * \details If the product of `num` and `size` is zero, the behavior of
 *      ::fwk_mm_alloc() is implementation-defined. For example, a null pointer
 *      may be returned. Alternatively, a non-null pointer may be returned; but
 *      such a pointer should not be dereferenced, and should be passed to
 *      ::fwk_mm_free() to avoid memory leaks.
 *
 * \note ::fwk_mm_alloc() is thread-safe: it behaves as though only accessing
 *      the memory locations visible through its argument, and not any static
 *      storage.
 *
 * \note A previous call to ::fwk_mm_free() or ::fwk_mm_realloc() that
 *      deallocates a region of memory synchronizes-with a call to
 *      ::fwk_mm_alloc() that allocates the same or a part of the same region
 *      of memory. This synchronization occurs after any access to the memory
 *      by the deallocating function and before any access to the memory by
 *      ::fwk_mm_alloc(). There is a single total order of all allocation and
