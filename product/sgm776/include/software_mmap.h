/*
 * The 4KiB AP/SCP Shared memory at the base of Trusted SRAM is used for several
 * purposes. These are: the Shared Data Storage (SDS) Memory Region, the SCMI
 * secure payload areas, and the context area for Application Processor
 * firmware.
 *
 * Shared Data Storage (SDS) Memory Region: Used for structured storage of data
 * that is shared between SCP Firmware and Application Processor firmware. The
 * SDS Memory Region occupies the area between the context region base and
 * the SCMI Secure Payload base.
 *
 * SCMI Secure Payload Areas: Storage for SCMI message contents in both the
 * Agent->Platform and Platform->Agent directions.
 *
 * Application Processor Context Area: The usage of this area is defined by the
 * firmware running on the Application Processors. The SCP Firmware must zero
 * this memory before releasing any Application Processors. This area must
 * always be located in the top 64 bytes of the 4KiB reserved region.
