 * Description:
 *      Common linker script configuration options.
 *
 * There are three supported memory layouts for the ARMv7-M architecture:
 *
 * Layout 1 - Single region:
 *      This layout uses a single read/write/execute memory region for all data.
 *      This is traditionally used by firmware running from a general-purpose
 *      RAM region. In this configuration MEM0 represents the RAM region, and
 *      MEM1 is unused.
 *
 * Layout 2 - Dual region with relocation:
 *      This layout uses a read/execute memory region for read-only and
 *      executable data, and a write memory region for writable data. This is
 *      traditionally used by firmware running from a ROM region. In this
 *      configuration MEM0 represents the ROM region and MEM1 represents the RAM
 *      region.
 *
 * Layout 3 - Dual region without relocation:
 *      This layout uses an execute memory region for executable data, and a
 *      read/write memory region for writable data. This is traditionally used
 *      by firmware running from a RAM region attached to the instruction bus.
 *      In this configuration MEM0 represents the RAM region attached to the
 *      instruction bus and MEM1 represents the RAM region attached to the data
 *      bus.
