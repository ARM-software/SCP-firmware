SCP-firmware - version 2.4.0
============================

New features
------------

- Module-based architecture with an event-driven execution model:
    - Firmware code is organized into modules, where a module fulfills a well-
      defined role (driver HAL, driver, protocol or service).
    - A framework drives the initialization, orchestration of, and interactions
      between modules.

- Processor-agnostic module code enables firmware portability across systems:
    - Processor-dependent features (e.g. interrupt handling) are abstracted from
      the modules by the framework.
    - The framework relies on an interface whose implementation is processor-
      dependent to provide these features.

- Module configurability easing the re-use of modules on different platforms:
    - Strict split between the hardware and software feature configuration data
      and module code.

- A native framework test suite provides rapid development and validation of the
  core framework implementation.

- Support for Armv7-M control processor architecture based on CMSIS v5 and Keil
  RTX 5.

- Provides system initialization support to enable boot of the application
  cores.

- Provides the following runtime services:
    - Power domain management
    - System power management
    - Performance domain management (Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling)
    - Clock management
    - Sensor management

- Provides a reference implementation of the System Control and Management
  Interface v1.0 (SCMI, platform-side). The SCMI specification can be found
  [here](http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.den0056a/DEN0056A_System_Control_and_Management_Interface.pdf).

- Provides a build system supporting:
    - The GNU Arm Embedded and Arm Compiler 6 toolchains
    - Platforms with multiple firmware images

- In-source Doxygen documentation

- Support for the SGM-775 platform

Known issues
------------

- The build system does not configure the compiler to avoid code generation of
  unaligned accesses. As ARMv7-M targets are configured to trap on unaligned
  word or halfword accesses, this can result in hardware exceptions.
  [This patch](https://github.com/ARM-software/SCP-firmware/commit/d2a77e0d4d0d369f7504c032a380578a4d145438)
  fixes this issue.
