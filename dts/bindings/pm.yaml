        Property to identify that a device can be used as wake up source.

        When this property is provided a specific flag is set into the
        device that tells the system that the device is capable of
        wake up the system.

        Wake up capable devices are disabled (interruptions will not wake up
        the system) by default but they can be enabled at runtime if necessary.
